NOTE: parts of the library might be under a different license:

* event.h is same license as above, but is closely modelled after libevent,
  so its license might apply even though its not obviously derived from it
  (it's the 3-clause bsd license).
* evdns.c is under public domain (so it says) but was taken out of libevent,
  so its license might apply.
